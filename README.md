# GenEd-1091-Zhuangzis-Butterfly-Effect
A game created by John Weaver, Will Smith, and Theo Glaeser for our GenEd 1091: Chinese Ethical and Politcal Philosophy final project. The game itself can be run through the GameCodeFinal.py file in a Python IDE. The writing can be quickly accessed through the brainstorming document pdf, with the artistic statement and contribution description in their according files.
